  <h1>ReceiptWise Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: <strong>December 28, 2025</strong></p>

  <div class="card">
    <p>
      ReceiptWise (“<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>”) is a receipt scanning and expense tracking app.
      This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      If you have questions, contact us at: <a href="mailto:matvey0501@gmail.com">matvey0501@gmail.com</a>
      <!-- Replace with your real email/address if needed -->
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We process receipt images and extracted text to create expense records.</li>
    <li>We may use third-party providers to deliver core functionality (e.g., cloud services, analytics, subscriptions).</li>
    <li>We do not sell your personal information.</li>
    <li>You can request deletion by removing your data in-app (where available) and/or contacting us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Depending on how you use the app, we may collect or process the following categories of information:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Receipt content you provide</strong>:
      images of receipts, extracted text (OCR/AI), and the expense fields you review or edit
      (merchant, date, total, currency, category, taxes, notes).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>App usage and diagnostics</strong>:
      basic analytics and crash/diagnostic data to help us improve stability and performance
      (e.g., device type, app version, error logs). This data generally does not include the full receipt image.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Subscription and purchase information</strong>:
      subscription status and entitlement information necessary to unlock Pro features.
      We do not receive your full payment card details. Payments are handled by Apple.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Identifiers</strong>:
      an app-specific identifier used to link subscription status and app configuration (for example, an anonymous user ID).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Provide the core service</strong>: scan receipts, extract data, and create expense records.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve accuracy and reliability</strong>: debugging, performance monitoring, and product improvements.</li>
    <li><strong>Subscriptions</strong>: verify purchases, restore purchases, and manage Pro entitlements.</li>
    <li><strong>Security</strong>: detect abuse, prevent fraud, and protect our systems.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where Your Data Is Processed</h2>
  <p>
    ReceiptWise may process data both <strong>on-device</strong> and <strong>using cloud services</strong>.
    If cloud processing is used (for example, to run AI extraction), receipt images and/or extracted text
    may be transmitted securely to our servers or service providers for processing and returned to the app.
  </p>

  <h2>Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
  <p>We share information only as needed to operate the app, for example with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Subscription provider</strong> (RevenueCat) to manage purchases, entitlements, and paywalls.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cloud infrastructure</strong> (e.g., Firebase / Google Cloud) to host backend functions and store
      configuration data, logs, or other app-related data.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>AI processing providers</strong> (if enabled in the app) to extract structured receipt fields from images/text.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Apple</strong> for in-app purchases and subscription billing.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="muted">
    Note: The exact providers may change over time as we improve the app. We aim to keep this policy up to date.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain information only as long as necessary to provide the service and for legitimate business purposes
    (such as debugging, security, and compliance), unless a longer retention period is required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Choices and Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Edit your data</strong>: You can review and edit extracted receipt fields before saving.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Delete expenses</strong>: You can delete saved expense records within the app.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Subscriptions</strong>: You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID settings.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Contact us</strong>: You can request help or deletion by emailing
      <a href="mailto:matvey0501@gmail.com">matvey0501@gmail.com</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>International Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Our service providers may process data in countries other than where you live.
    We take reasonable steps to protect your information, including using encryption in transit where appropriate.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information.
    However, no security system is perfect, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    ReceiptWise is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your country).
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the date above
    and, where appropriate, provide additional notice within the app.
